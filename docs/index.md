# Words of Power Editor

**Words of Power Editor** (`wopeditor`) is a free and open source app
for creation, modification, distribution, and machine recognition of
custom magic symbols in [TexnoMagic] format used in upcoming
[texnoforge] game [Words of Power] and any other games/apps
that choose to adopt this open format and/or tool.

Read more in [intro](intro.md).


## Status

### wopeditor is being rewriten in [Godot] ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

This is a 3rd iteration of wopeditor UI after previous versions in Unreal Engine and Kivy.
I like Godot a lot so far, this might be the final implementation.

You can use previous [python-wopeditor] until this new Godot version
reaches feature parity.


## Usage

Simply open the project in [Godot Editor](https://godotengine.org/download):

```
git clone https://github.com/texnoforge/wopeditor
cd wopeditor
godot project.godot
```

Native binaries will be provided in the future.
