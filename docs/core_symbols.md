# Core Symbols Challenge

We are in the very beginning of the journey towards **Words of Power**.

As a first step we need to create atomic elements of [Magic][magic] - **symbols**.

I've selected an initial set of symbols that will serve as a solid base for a
magic system and I need **you** to help me find their representations!

In other words, I want you to **draw symbols for basic concepts** below.

## Symbol Drawing

Let's define **drawing of a symbol** (or just **drawing**) to be a series of 2D curves graphically
representing a symbol.

There are **no colors** associated with a symbol, only **shape** and **orientation**.

This is a rough equivalent of pen & paper.

Symbols will be repeatedly drawn by mages using various pointing
devices so **drawings** must not be overly complex or otherwise annoying to
replicate.

Finally, symbols need to be distinct. No two symbols should be similar.


## Use wopeditor, paper, strings or whatever else you want

I've [released Words of Power Editor v0.1.0][v0.1.0] which you can use to draw
symbols using mouse (and other pointing devices) in **TexnoMagic** format
which allows easy sharing of entire magic alphabet as a single zip fil and you
can even upload your alphabet to [wop.mod.io](https://wop.mod.io) where
everyone with (or without) `wopeditor` can download and modify it easily.

Please see [wopeditor installation](install.md), it's easy.

If you don't want to use my experimental software, **please feel free to
draw symbols using any method you want** as long as you can share a
picture of result.

## Share your Drawings â™¥

Any amount of symbols is welcome, no need to draw them all.

Thanks a lot, I hope you have a creative time with symbols and concepts!
