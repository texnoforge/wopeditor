# Core Symbols Challenge

We are in the very beginning of the journey towards **Words of Power**.

As a first step we need to create atomic elements of [Magic][magic] - **symbols**.

I've selected an initial set of symbols that will serve as a solid base for a
magic system and I need **you** to help me find their representations!

In other words, I want you to **draw symbols for basic concepts** below.

## Symbol Drawing

Let's define **drawing of a symbol** (or just **drawing**) to be a series of 2D curves graphically
representing a symbol.

There are **no colors** associated with a symbol, only **shape** and **orientation**.

The **size**/**scale** doesn't matter.

This is a rough equivalent of pen & paper.

Symbols will be repeatedly drawn by mages using various pointing
devices so **drawings** must not be overly complex or otherwise annoying to
replicate.

Finally, symbols need to be distinct. No two symbols should be too similar.


## Use wopeditor, paper, strings or whatever else you want

You can use [wopeditor][wopeditor-itch]
to draw symbols using mouse (and other pointing devices) in [TexnoMagic] format
which allows easy sharing of entire magic alphabet as a single zip file and you
can even upload your alphabet to [wop.mod.io](https://wop.mod.io) where everyone
with (or without) `wopeditor` can download and modify it easily.

If you don't want to use my experimental software, **please feel free to
draw symbols using any method you want**, as long as you can share a
picture of the result.


## Symbols in search of Form

Use the power of your mind to translate following words into their basic symbolic
form:

### elements

* fire
* ice
* lightning / electro
* water
* air
* earth
* life
* death


### shapes (spell carriers)

* bolt / missile / projectile
* ball / exploding projectile
* beam / line
* area / circle
* cone


### targets

* self / I
* friend
* enemy


### selectors

* close
* far
* weak
* strong
* random
* all


### modifiers

* big
* small
* fast
* slow
* homing


## Share your Drawings â™¥

If using [wopeditor][wopeditor-itch], you can upload to [wop.mod.io](https://wop.mod.io). I made a simple
[HOWTO](https://wop.mod.io/guides/words-of-power-mod-upload-howto).

You can also share your drawings on [#wopeditor discord][discord] or use the
ancient tech of e-mail:
[wop@texnoforge.dev](mailto:wop@texnoforge.dev)

Any amount of symbols is welcome, no need to draw them all.

Thanks a lot, I hope you have a creative time with symbols and concepts!
